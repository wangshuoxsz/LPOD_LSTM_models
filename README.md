**the dataset for model training / experiments results can be accessed by the folloing link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Sel0G5p7FA6kI_o4fIOsBezMT4WoZ96h?usp=sharing**

To verify the model perormance, first download the LPOD_LSTM_models (from github) and LPOD_LSTM_data (from the google drive) to the local path, then change the model name and path in the 'configuration.yaml' and run the 'main.py'.
